### G'day !


I'm Pedro from Australia. I first graduated in Business(accounting) and am currenty pursuing my Master's Degree in Computer Science. I am passionate about data and all the information and knowledge it generates. In my data science projects i used Python, R, ML, SQL and Tableau, but i'm always looking for more tools to incorporate into my skills.

# [Project 1](https://github.com/pedro-vasconcelos-costa/KNN-Classifier)
## KNN Classifier

While there are several other Machine Learning techniques capable of solving much more complex problems and tackling grater dimensions of data and number of parameters involved, choosing some of them for this specific task could be considered an overkill. The use of AI must follow a sustainable proposition and justify the amount of time and resources dedicated to its implementation. The KNN model bears plenty of capability to handle the classification of the Iris Flower dataset.
