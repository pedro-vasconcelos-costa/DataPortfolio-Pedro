### G'day !


I'm Pedro, a graduate in Computer Science. I first graduated in Business(accounting) and am currenty pursuing my Master's Degree in Computer Science. I am passionate about Data Science & Analytics and all the insights and knowledge it generates. In my data science projects I used Python, R, ML, SQL and Tableau, but I'm always looking for more tools to incorporate into my skills.
